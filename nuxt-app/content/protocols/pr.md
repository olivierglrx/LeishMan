  ## 🧫 Procedure

  ### 1. **Media Preparation**

  - Warm RPMI 1640 medium to 37°C.
  - Add 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (optional).
  - Filter sterilize and store at 4°C.

  ### 2. **Inoculation**

  - Under sterile conditions, transfer _Leishmania_ parasites to fresh medium.
  - Inoculate 5–10 mL of culture into a 25 cm² flask.
  - Incubate at 25–26°C in a BOD incubator or benchtop area (no CO₂ required).

  ### 3. **Maintenance**

  - Monitor parasite density under the microscope daily.
  - Subculture every 3–4 days or when cell density reaches ~1×10⁷ cells/mL.

  ### 4. **Cell Count and Viability**

  - Mix 10 µL of culture with 10 µL of Trypan Blue.
  - Load onto hemocytometer.
  - Count live (unstained) vs dead (blue) cells.
  - Calculate viability:
